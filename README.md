This C++ program implements a basic console calculator that performs one of four arithmetic 
operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division — on two user-provided double values.

readNumber() function asks the user to enter a double.
readSign() function asks the user to enter a basic math operation sign.

printResult(double first, double second) function takes two parameters and performs a switch statement and displays the formated result.
